        <p>A <b>Father</b> is the male parent of a <i>child</i>. Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain <mark>rights and obligations</mark>. A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation. A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of<del>monetary</del> support. An adoptive <u>father is a man who has become the child's parent</u> through the legal process of adoption. </p><hr>
